# Python-CoffeeMachineProject

## Description

This project was created by myself during the 15th day of the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) challenge. The Coffee Machine Program is designed to simulate the operation of a coffee machine. It can take user orders for espresso, latte, and cappuccino, process payments, and manage resources like water, milk, coffee, and money.

This is made in such a way that you can easily modify the types of drinks within the data.py folder and add new drinks as per your wish.

## Usage

To use the Coffee Machine Program, follow these steps:

1. Start the program.
2. Enter your drink choice: espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
3. Follow the prompts to insert coins.
4. If you've inserted enough money and resources are available, the program will make your drink and provide change (if necessary).
5. You can also request a report of the machine's current resource levels.

Feel free to experiment with different drink choices, check the resources, and make coffee. Enjoy your coffee-making experience!
